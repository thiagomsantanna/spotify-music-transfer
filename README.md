# Spotify Music Transfer

- Once i needed to create a new account on spotify and stop using my years old account, that i have so many playlists and liked musics. So, to doesnt have to manually add all that songs or simply doest add any songs and build my taste all again in the new account, i coded a simple script with python to do this work for me:

### Requirements 
 - To work well, i used my exported data from my old account. To get yours go to [privacy page on your spotify account settings](https://www.spotify.com/br/account/privacy/) and follow the steps to get your data downloaded

### Playlist's
 - With your spotify data just paste the playlist json data in the directory
   - By default, i commited the code with `Playlist1.json`, that was my playlists data json
 - To run the playlist script, nothing new, just: `py plasylisttransfer.py` on terminal
   - (terminal printscreen)
